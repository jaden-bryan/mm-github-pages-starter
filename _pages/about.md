I am a high school senior at San Juan Hills High School.  I have a passion for computer and political science as well as statistical models and marine biology.

I have interned at the Ocean Institute, GPSfx, and the UCI ethics centered focusing on building my experience with software development, research, and empowering citizens.  

Some projects I have been involved in include building a neural network application for use by visitors to the Ocean Institute and a blockchain-based virtual equity platform utilized by thousands of students in the Virtual Enterprise program.
